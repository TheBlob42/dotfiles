#  XCompose
  
Custom configuration file for the X11 compose key.

Make it easier and faster to type German umlauts (`äöüÄÖÜ`) by defining the following keybindings:

| Keybinding | Character |
|:-----------|:---------:|
| CK + o + o | ö         |
| CK + O + o | Ö         |
| CK + o + O | Ö         |
| CK + ä + ä | ä         |
| CK + Ä + ä | Ä         |
| CK + ä + Ä | Ä         |
| CK + u + u | ü         |
| CK + U + u | Ü         |
| CK + u + U | Ü         |
 
> This will overwrite some of the default keybindings, but all the others remain untouched

##  Installation
   
Simply copy the file and put it into your home directory.

You need to log out or restart the computer in order to activate the changes.
